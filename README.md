# Junto Select — website

The Junto Select events landing page, built with Next.js (App Router) +
TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. Single page for now; structured so
`/introductions` and other pages can be added later without rework.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. `npm run build` / `npm run start` for a
production build, `npm run lint` for ESLint + TypeScript checks.

```

## Assets

**No photography or logo file is in this repository yet.** Neither the chat
attachments nor AI-generated photography could be produced in this
environment (no accessible attachment files, no image-generation tool) — see
`ASSETS.md` for the three photography slots (hero, Who You'll Meet, Private/
Curated/Personal), the creative brief for each, and the exact file paths to
drop real files into. Every photography slot currently renders as an
abstract warm-toned panel (`src/components/Photo.tsx`) rather than a fake or
stock photo of people.

## Brevo configuration required

The form posts to `POST /api/invitation`, which calls the Brevo Contacts
API server-side (`src/lib/brevo.ts`) — the API key never reaches the
browser.

1. Set `BREVO_API_KEY` in your deployment environment (see
   `.env.example`). Without it the route returns a `503` and the form shows
   a graceful error — this is expected until the key is configured.
2. Optionally set `BREVO_LIST_ID` to attach new contacts to a specific
   Brevo list. Without it, contacts are still created/updated in Brevo,
   just without a list.
3. **Create these Contact Attributes in Brevo** (Contacts → Settings →
   Contact attributes) before going live — the API rejects attributes it
   doesn't recognize:

   | Attribute (as sent) | Suggested Brevo type | Source field |
   |---|---|---|
   | `NOMBRE` | Text | Nombre |
   | `GENERO` | Text (or Category: `Mujer` / `Hombre`) | Soy |
   | `PROFESION` | Text | Profesión / Cargo (only sent if filled) |
   | `TELEFONO` | Text | Teléfono (only sent if filled; kept as free text rather than Brevo's built-in SMS/phone attribute, which requires strict E.164 formatting) |
   | `SOBRE_TI` | Multiline text (needs to hold up to 600 characters) | Cuéntanos sobre ti (only sent if filled) |
   | `EDAD_35_MAS` | Boolean | Age confirmation checkbox |
   | `CONSENTIMIENTO_COMUNICACIONES` | Boolean | Consent checkbox |
   | `CONSENTIMIENTO_FECHA` | Date/text (ISO datetime) | Recorded automatically, for consent-proof purposes |

   These names are placeholders chosen to be self-explanatory — rename them
   in `src/lib/brevo.ts` to match your Brevo account if you'd rather reuse
   existing attributes.
4. The route uses `updateEnabled: true`, so a repeat submission from the
   same email updates the existing Brevo contact rather than erroring.

## Privacy notes

- Submitted form data is only ever sent to Brevo; nothing is logged,
  stored in this repo, or sent to analytics.
- Server logs on failure record only an HTTP status/error class, never the
  submitted name/email/etc.
